# Crack Pass

CrackPass is a powerful password strength analyzer designed for real-world scenarios. Instead of just checking for uppercase letters and symbols, CrackPass simulates brute force and wordlist attacks to estimate how easily a password could be cracked. It provides a realistic strength score, cracking time estimates, and improvement suggestions — all in a clean CLI interface.

## Features

- Brute Force Simulation

- Wordlist Attack Simulation

- Hybrid Mode (Brute + Wordlist together)

- Strength Scoring

- Improvement Suggestions

- Command Line Interface (CLI)
